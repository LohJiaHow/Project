            <div>The McLaren P1 is a sports car produced by British marque McLaren Automotive. It is a plug-in hybrid
                with a mid-engine layout. It was first shown at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, with sales of the P1
                beginning in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all of the limited run of 375 units sold by November
                2013.

                It is the fastest track-focused road hypercar we have ever built, and it will set the fastest lap times
                of any McLaren to date. That is what has driven us to build a track car that is unashamedly without
                compromise. One that is legalised for road use, but not sanitised to suit it. Nothing else matters but
                to deliver the most intense driving experience around a circuit.
